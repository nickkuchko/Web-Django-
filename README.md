# Web-Django-

Hi everyone. 
My name is Nick and this is my first web project Books & Notes which is designed to store books on various branches of IT, astronomy and the history of mankind.
The site is currently still in the process of comprehension and will be finalized.
The project code itself is not quite optimal yet and will be gradually optimized.
In the near future, a basic template for all pages will be added, and the "Store" tab will also be developed.
The software requirements can be found in the requirements file.
Have a nice day.
