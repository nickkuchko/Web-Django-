# Web-Django-

Hi everyone. 
My name is Nick and this is my first web project Books & Notes which is designed to store books on various branches of IT, astronomy and the history of mankind. The project implements a contact form for sending a message to the site owner. Currently, messages are output to the console. The Log in and Sign up features are also implemented. Depending on this, the user has different functionality. The project also implements the ability to quickly access social networks to repost a page (using JS).
The site is currently still in the process of comprehension and will be finalized.
The project code itself is not quite optimal yet and will be gradually optimized.
In the near future, a basic template for all pages will be added, and the "Store" tab will also be developed using JavaScript (I'm currently still studying JS).
The software requirements can be found in the requirements file.
Have a nice day.
